Hello, **BLiPPER**!

This is the documentation for **BLiP Toolkit**. Here you will get to know the classes and patterns which compose the elements from **BLiP's platform**.

**BLiP Toolkit** is a compilation of SCSS configuration and Vanilla JS components made to fit **BLiP**'s needs. The toolkit was created in order to standardize CSS specifications and component behavious between all of **BLiP**'s products. From the simplest details, like typography and section dividers, to more complex components, such as tag selectors, **BLiP Toolkit** makes for an easy implementation of styles and functionalities.

It is important to read the documentation and be aware of our design patterns. That way, the project's code will be more organized and future changes will be easier.


<h3> Design Principles </h3>

Our **design principles** help maintain a visual quality that reflects the values and characteristics of our brand.

- **Reliability through consistency:** componentes must communicate with each other and be hierarchical, representing **BLiP**'s design as a family in the smallest details.
- **Empowering users through simplicity:** our design mitigates visual interference, helping users focus on what is important, learn and evolve faster.
- **Familiarity, elegance and innovation:** Elements reproduce behaviour that mimics the real world: they have weight and are influenced by light, moviment and other phenomenons.
- **Constant evolution - "Level Up":** Improvements are made alongside users, strengthening **BLiP**'s community.
