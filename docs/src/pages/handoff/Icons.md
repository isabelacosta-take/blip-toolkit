Icons and logos are handed-off as compressed SVGs, with specific names and sizes.

Icons are symbols used as semantic images, usually as action buttons or menu links. These symbols mostly will be saved on 24 pixels by 24 pixels (24x24px) SVG files.

<h3> One-colored Icons </h3>

One-colored icons must be saved with no fill modification (visually, they will be black). When a designer is creating such icons, they must think SVG areas should always be painted black (not filled) and hollow on the inside. It is better NOT to use masks or other tricks, but draw exactly the shape a designer wants before saving the SVG. In other words, icon shapes must be draw as they are, not be created with visual effects.

After saving one or many SVGs, one must pass such SVGs through


Hello, **BLiPPER**!

This is the documentation for **BLiP Toolkit**. Here you will get to know the classes and patterns which compose the elements from **BLiP's platform**.

**BLiP Toolkit** is a compilation of SCSS configuration and Vanilla JS components made to fit **BLiP**'s needs. The toolkit was created in order to standardize CSS specifications and component behavious between all of **BLiP**'s products. From the simplest details, like typography and section dividers, to more complex components, such as tag selectors, **BLiP Toolkit** makes for an easy implementation of styles and functionalities.

It is important to read the documentation and be aware of our design patterns. That way, the project's code will be more organized and future changes will be easier.


<h3> Design Principles </h3>

Our **design principles** help maintain a visual quality that reflects the values and characteristics of our brand.

- **Reliability through consistency:** componentes must communicate with each other and be hierarchical, representing **BLiP**'s design as a family in the smallest details.
- **Empowering users through simplicity:** our design mitigates visual interference, helping users focus on what is important, learn and evolve faster.
- **Familiarity, elegance and innovation:** Elements reproduce behaviour that mimics the real world: they have weight and are influenced by light, moviment and other phenomenons.
- **Constant evolution - "Level Up":** Improvements are made alongside users, strengthening **BLiP**'s community.


<h3> Installation </h3>

To install **BLiP Toolkit** in your project, use ```npm install blip-toolkit```
